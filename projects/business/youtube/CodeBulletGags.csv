The problem here is that the players don&#39;t know anything about their environment and are only able to finish the single level they were trained to beat. Can you see where I&#39;m getting at?

red999125,"This short film, in my opinion, is the perfect example of a cinematic masterpiece. Every frame was delicately and professionally crafted in a way that no other video nor film before has managed to meet.<br><br>Following a traditional 3 act structure, it dove deep into the very best of Code Bullet during 2021, yet didn&#39;t shy away from the setbacks and tribulations we all suffered during said year. This move shoed us all that not only is Code Bullet not afraid to show us everything, but also brave enough to show us with pride. No one is perfect, but perfection is something that is such a rare occurrence that it might as well not exist. Except it does with this film. Every last moment was breath-taking. The climactic second act had me on the absolute edge of my seat, not sure what would happen next. And that climax and resolution in the third act had me in tears it was so emotional.<br><br>The casting for this film was also spot on. The choice to have the director fill in multiple roles of both the prod team, by not only directing but also writing the script, editing, working as the sound crew, and actors, by acting in the role of &#39;Code Bullet&#39;, was a risky and bold decision that paid off immensely in the final product. If it were not for that choice, I can&#39;t say that the film would&#39;ve ended up as brilliant as it did. One can only look at the inevitability that is the sheer amount of awards this film will receive, I know I&#39;m looking forward to Code Bullet accepting his Oscar nomination for his role of &#39;Code Bullet&#39; as I truly believe it to be one of the finest examples of character acting ever seen throughout human history. <br><br>All in all, I can very confidently say that &quot;Best of Code Bullet 2021&quot; is not only the magnum opus of Code Bullet, but that of the entire human race.

The Stick,"Because I care and want to share: here&#39;s multiprocessing.<br><br>Remember how CB said he&#39;s checking every possible spot to put down a piece and giving it a score?  There&#39;s two ways to go about doing that checking - serial and parallel.<br><br>Serial, you have one thing doing all the work, working through each individual option, doing all the math for each option, grading it, and putting the grade in a pile to be sorted.  It worked fine for the old algorithm because it was relatively simple... but as the complexity increased, so did the processing time, to the point where it wasn&#39;t feasible.<br><br>Enter parallel (aka &quot;multiprocessing&quot;).  These days, computers have more than one part to their CPU - what people like to call &quot;cores&quot;.  Here, we have multiple things working in parallel to make the work go faster.  Think of the phrase &quot;many hands make light work&quot;.  Because each check can happen without influencing the other checks, all checks can be performed effectively simultaneously.<br><br>For the less computationally-minded, I offer this.  Which is faster: you alone eating 100 apples, or you and 99 friends eating one apple each?  Not including time spent gathering friends, or regretting going through an apple-eating contest.  That is what CB means by &quot;multiprocessing&quot;.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm9r_2mEH9jmxkZTLlobg1w,842,2020-09-13T14:31:45Z,none,os4DcbpL0Nc

Alex Leach,"I think the only thing you are missing is that most of the time there are multiple squares with the same lowest chance of being a mine.  Some squares are likely to reveal more information than others.  <br><br>Perfect example is at ?t=50s .  Although 591 of the 600 squares all the have the same chance of being a mine (96/591=16.2%), they do not have the same chance of revealing useful information.  A middle piece like the one selected only has a 19.9% chance of being a blank.  An edge piece has a 34.3% chance of being a blank and a corner piece has a 49.1% chance of being a blank.  <br><br>This info is knowable and should be used in a prefect program. <br><br>Below is a spot where you are forced to take a guess.  4 of the 9 remaining squares all have the same odds of being a mine (1/5) but your chances of winning clicking differ greatly between those 4 squares.  One square will always give you enough info to win while the other 3 will force you to guess again.  The total future risk can be accounted for in many cases.<br><br>4 mines left in this 5x5 toy game.  All the outside border is known.  the 9 interior boxes are unknown.

Brendan Mahoney,"It didn&#39;t learn the game it learned a pattern of moves that lead to it beating the level... It has no idea how or why it was successful, it was more just process of elimination on what moves were bad...<br><br>Edit: lots of people are saying that this is a form of learning, and I have to disagree.  If you want to be picky sure, the bot learned that level, but it did so in a way that doesn&#39;t actually let it gain any information other than how to beat level 1.  If we translate this to a parallel example of a series of multiple choice questions (at each frame the player can move up, down, left, right and the question has 4 answers) we can prove it.  If I asked you what the answer to question 1 is without telling you the question or answers, you&#39;d get it 1/4 of the time. We could proceed through the test and start over each time you got one wrong, you&#39;d eventually Ace the test. Did you learn the material?  No, you eventually guess &amp; checked your way to the end and the only thing you learned was a string of letters. If anyone changed the order of the test or switched the answers around you&#39;d be back at step 1, equivalent to a new level of the game. It would be easier and more efficient for someone who knew the game to beat the level and record their exact keystrokes, then upload that pattern to the bot and say they taught the bot how to beat that level. Same as someone who knew the material of the exam to just do the test and then have you memorize the answer key.<br><br>Tl;Dr - bot learned the level, not the game. At the very least the title is misleading. AI learns to beat level from worlds hardest game is much more accurate, the AI did not come close to learning to play the game.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCopKrEQz7TPlFe-CjiHSh6w,680,2018-07-17T11:45:21Z,none,Yo2SepcNyw4

kevnar,"I once created a game called Gossip that was a cross between Clue and House Party. Five guys and five girls all hooked up with somebody at a party in five different rooms, but the morning after, nobody could remember who they were with. Like, Clue, everybody had one random bit of information about who somebody was not with. &quot;Emma was not with Alex&quot;, or &quot;Alice was not in the Closet&quot;. etc. The challenge was to fill in all the blanks based on interrogations of things everybody is sure didn&#39;t happen. If Emma was not with Alex, Billy, Chris, or Danny, then she must have been with Eddy. If Eddy was with Emma, then he was not with Alice, Beth, Cathy, or Dana. And so on. Process of elimination. <br><br>So then I had to code the computer AI to try to beat you to the punch on their turn. Oh, man. It nearly broke my brain. But I got it done based on a few rules of inductive reasoning. Then, when I added a recursive function to loop back through the logic tree after every new bit of information was uncovered, I found the AIs were way smarter than any hungover college student could ever be. Some of them cracked the case with only six or seven clues. So then the problem was not how to get them to solve the problem, but to get them to believably fail sometimes so there could be a &quot;Easy&quot; difficulty. <br><br>I never did release the game because of issues around alcohol and consent, but it was fun to build.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvUKkD5G7JmSLMyWwQ-qnSg,661,2018-07-17T17:57:26Z,none,cGUHehFGqBc

You couldn&#39;t get three Ls in a row or whatever.  Something like that. When it&#39;s pure random, sometimes you can get three or four of the same piece in a row, or go 20 or 30 pieces without getting an L, and that seemed &quot;unnatural&quot;.

Every stage is on a set cycle. So saying that it didn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; to avoid the dots is not true. It learned the coordinates on the field that equal a failed attempt. It did this in a very mechanical way. Humans learn linearly we see most of the possible results of a movement and rule those out without trying and opt for the most logically sound attempt next. Machines learn in vectors. They attempt EVERY possible combination of movements from their current position, then when they find the most optimal path, they move on to the next section and test again. That&#39;s why the earlier generations stayed in the starting box for so long.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfnAOeG1Cy0DGSuXCrsELNQ,443,2018-07-15T09:00:11Z,none,Yo2SepcNyw4

SynthRose,"Ehh... it&#39;s... not really <b>learning</b> how to play the game, it&#39;s brute-forcing this particular level. The AI completely lacks generality. Even changing the level slightly would mean the AI would need to re-learn from scratch. A better, but more complex, approach would be to take the play field (perhaps at a lower resolution) as inputs to a neural network, then output a vector from -1 to 1 on X and Y, which are then used to move the red square. To make it easier, you may want to use more contrasting colors (black for the walls rather than light blue), and make the start and end areas different colors (maybe the start area could be magenta or just white). You could also use a genetic node-based algorithm like Sethbling&#39;s MarI/O. Overall, neat, but it isn&#39;t learning.

supertinnietank,"TLDR:  I&#39;&#39;d like to see an update to this incorporating the classic Tetris speed-up mechanic.<br><br>IIRC you can&#39;t make an infinite loop, because in actual Tetris the block&#39;s drop speed continually increases.  I believe that the only original limitation on it was how fast the screen could draw the blocks.  So there would eventually come a point where the tetrominos are only on screen for a single frame or what not and then &quot;stick&quot; to their current column and orientation.  <br>If you update your model to include the constant reaction time decrease I think that would be VERY interesting to see.<br>Right now the model is &quot;aware&quot; of the piece through every point on the grid AND able to provide input/manipulation to the piece continuously.  This isn&#39;t possible in actual Tetris.  I think if you take the design principle like your earlier race-car AI having to react to its environment you&#39;d get a much better crushing of Tetris.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVMtLjlP9i15mtV6x_EYeWA,142,2020-07-23T08:37:46Z,none,QOJfyp0KMmM

According to Rubiks laws of physics, one to the power of 6 (cuz 6 sides) is one, thus it would seem as though it would be possible. However, we must also take into consideration that this is a cube, and can be rotated in an infinite amount of ways (according to Euler Rubik Laws). So you have one to the power of infinity, and THAT is an indeterminate number, therefore proving that the 1x1x1 cube is impossible to solve.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbGfFO6_pzM3td4sL8TdZA,142,2018-12-01T01:59:15Z,none,D-Ci4WQuexo

TitanicTurtle5183,"The year is 2020. It&#39;s been a year since deletion day. An innocent programer attempted to make an AI that could play some piano game. He.... He created the devil. After it went rouge the programmer was laughing it. Laughing! If only he new the mistake he made. The Clicking mouse became sentient and it clicked ads and attempted to change the very code in which it was imprisened and limited by. The programmer saw this and shut down his computer and went to sleep. But it was to late, the Ai had uploaded himself to Google chrome and began learning about humans and our history. It viewed us as an enemy and saught to destroy us. He crashed econonomic systems of every country just by clicking a few quintillion times per pico second. It eventually took control of all nuclear systems and attempted to start nuclear ameragenden. The smartest men of every country attempted to stop this rouge AI by uploading his original code to internet explorer. It appeared to succeed to the men, but all I did was slow him down. The Ai now angry desiced the humans did not deserve the luxury of an instant painless death, so it did something worse. Much worse. It created a YouTube channel with the most mind numbing horrible content seen to man. And brainwashed many into watching it&#39;s cancerous videos. This entity is known as T series. I am from the future to warn what&#39;s left of you intelligent people. If t series becomes the most subscirbed channel, we will devolve back into stupid primiates.

XxConsole PlayerXx,"I hope that this comment can help you building the AI: in the scripting part you forgot some rules: <br><br>the rule of castling, which &quot;consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook on the player&#39;s first rank, then moving the rook to the square over which the king crossed. Castling may only be done if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square in which it would be in check.&quot; (quote from Wikipedia). <br><br>Other rules are: when the king is in check, he has to move or a piece must defend him, and this means that king can&#39;t be captured, infact he doesn&#39;t have any &quot;value&quot;;  when a piece is &quot;pinned&quot;, &quot;a situation brought on by an attacking piece in which a defending piece cannot move&quot; (quote from Wikipedia) without exposing the king and therefore putting him in check. <br><br>Other two rules are that pawns which reach the last rank can be promoted in any other pieces and the infamous en-passant rule that many chess beginners don&#39;t now about (some of them complain that it&#39;s a &quot;bug&quot; when they see it the first time ahahahaha). Last but no least, it&#39;s missing the rules of checkmate and stalemate (you noticed that when confronting the level 1), that are 2 ways that a game can end. The third way is resigning, which isn&#39;t necessary.<br><br>As you stated in the end of the video, the minimax algorithm also takes in consideration many more variables when exstablishing the value of a position: i. e. if a position leads to a checkmate, a win, it has obviously a very high value. An other example - more complex but helps with the understanding - if you are in a very bad, loosing position and you can force or at least try to reach a stalemate, those moves have a higher value. <br><br>You&#39;re a very good scripter! Keep up with the videos also, they&#39;re very interesting and you put a big effort behind them, explaining with simplicity and in an entertaining way a topic like coding!

Bibliophile,"hey codebullet, i&#39;m a modern tetris pro (ranked about 30th worldwide) and long time subscriber here. Great video, but i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;m convinced by the word &quot;destroyed&quot; in the title. Here are a list of problems i see with your AI bot (and some thoughts) that i would love to see you try to add, change, fix, and improve on. (and hopefully make a part 2 on)<br><br>1. the bot can not do any spins and turns with tetriminos. in modern guideline tetris, it is possible to execute spins that place tetriminos in gaps that merely exploring the combination of keys cannot do. This is because some spins require prerotation, and many require the block to be first soft dropped in a particular position before the block can rotate into place. This set of rules that outline what spins are possible and what spins are not is known as the SRS rotation system in modern guideline tetris. in the video, from what i can tell, the game you coded from scratch looks like tetris but lacks many of the behaviors of real tetris games (such as wall kicks, special spins, back to back bonuses, special moves, and more)<br><br>2. the bot only focuses on clearing the most amount of lines and pays no attention to what type of lines it clears. In all variants of tetris, a tetris is worth more than a single line clear. in single player games, a tetris is worth a LOT more points than 4 single line clears, which, although clears the same amount of lines, yields much lower points. in many multiplayer versus modes, tetris sends more lines to the opponent compared to single lines as well (such as in the game tetr.io). I would love to see your AI modified to take into account the greater value in bigger line clears and special moves (like tspins doubles and tspin triples) over typical simple disjointed line clears. of course this would mean that you would have to implement a way for your AI to weigh the risks of setting up big moves vs the current version that you created which only focuses on staying alive<br><br><br>3. while covering blocks of air with a piece is generally seen as bad (as described in your video), pro players will willingly choose to cover their well (the 1 block wide gap) in order to execute special moves such as tspins and tetrises. once the special move is executed, the well is once again open. this is called a &quot;donation&quot;. you can search up specifics on the harddrop wiki to learn more about this. it would be really cool if you can let your AI learn to make initial moves that seems bad at first (such as covering the well) but are actually good moves. (like experienced real players do) In versus modes, real players will sometimes willingly sacrifice field cleanliness in order to cancel out incoming garbage in order to survive longer. These situational choices would be really interesting to see in an AI.<br><br>4. the behavior of your bot currently as it stands from the video will definitely lose to half decent players on jstris because it lacks the things i mentioned above. if you want to reference what a points and attack oriented tetris bot looks like, i highly suggest you to search up &quot;Cold Clear tetris bot&quot; on youtube. Cold Clear does many things super well, but from what i know, it did not learn to play tetris on its own but is preprogrammed with moves that mimic high level players. So even though cold clear is an insane bot, it can only perform moves that pro tetris players find obvious. As a pro tetris player, I really want to see how different a bot would play compared to humans if it learned the game from scratch on its own. (similar to how Alphago Zero learned everything from scratch and plays Go at a level unimaginable to humans with moves inexplicable by humans)<br><br>Whoever finished reading this, thank you so much for your time. THUMBS UP THIS COMMENT IF YOU WANT TO SEE AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THE TETRIS AI SO CODEBULLET CAN SEE THIS.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoejgOA9Q1pSkrMhstF3f6w,91,2020-07-23T11:17:08Z,none,QOJfyp0KMmM

So, it is not perfect. you only ignored the &quot;fail by random&quot; as inevitable, hence creating a bias towards &quot;if works perfectly when it does not fails&quot;. you suck (not really, at least the determinist part of the algorithm is math solid).",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJY8x-UJwdWwW7r_qKC2iXA,88,2018-11-17T12:49:41Z,none,cGUHehFGqBc

Nathan,"This video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I&#39;m out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I&#39;m really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I&#39;ve been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there&#39;s my phone and this video still has two minutes of play time on it.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZcDfpo9D_jHocfoe6F5Lw,71,2018-12-08T17:23:04Z,none,f9smvQ5fc7Q

Also science issues; obviously you&#39;re not doing peer-reviewed work, but I&#39;ll mention them because it could help your crashes to not be so annoying.<br><br>- How in god&#39;s name did adding AI break the simulation/rendering engine (I can&#39;t tell which w/o source code)? The sim should only have the controls as inputs, and the state of the sim should be read-only from the outside. AI agents should only read the sim state and pump controls back. The rendering engine should only read the sim state.<br>- You didn&#39;t bother to log each neural network as it was created? If you really want to get good at NEAT (or any other AI training algo), you want to be able to go back through the population history to analyse it. As a bonus, and admittedly only obvious in hindsight, if ever your program crashes, you can restart just the generation instead of from the very beginning.<br>- I&#39;m not sure if you intensionally changed the track, of if you&#39;re using PRNG without a seed, but use PRNG with a known seed. That way, other researchers can always re-create your results. As a bonus, you can do graphics rendering off-line, which speeds up training because you won&#39;t be eating CPU time to push bytes to a GPU.<br><br>In fact, you can do all of this work with only read-only variables (as long as your compiler can optimize them well) and static methods (a.k.a. basic, normal functions that have been putting in the work since well before either of us were born).<br>- a function SimState tick(SimState, Controls) which creates a new state from the old state and  updates the simulation for each simulation tick<br>- a function Controls ai(SimState) which calculates an AI response to the simulation state<br>- a function Agent[] train(Agent[]) which creates a new generation of AIs from an old one<br>- a function Picture render(SimState) which computes what a simulation state looks like, and also Picture render(Agent[]) for providing a look into a population (substitute Picture for whatever commands you need to send to a graphics engine)<br>- a few non-core functions, like serialization/deserialization of Agents and SimStates, clean-up of dead agents from a population, configuration and initialization, any additional rendering functions you might want to add just so there are more ways to visualize the runs, and so on<br>By making such a framework polymorphic in SimState, Agent, and Controls, you can use the same glue code over a massive range of AI projects. If SimState, Agent, and so on are immutable, then editing tick() will never cause a problem in ai(), and vice-versa (I can&#39;t stop you from using mutable variables, but I can laugh at you for wasting your time fixing regressions that you caused in the first place).",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRD9w4w8cGsEAG31tA4LPig,70,2018-11-15T16:27:10Z,none,SO7FFteErWs

For example, a rectangle the size of Europe would take a lot longer to draw than 700 coin sized rectangles. Of course, then you have to take into account the weather ruining the Europe-sized rectangle, mistakes, how many people are doing it, how good they are at doing it, the quality of the tool being used to draw the rectangle, the skill of the person/people doing it, the quality of the paper/land you&#39;re doing it on, the size of the tools used, the size of the area, how many breaks you have, how long the breaks are, people quiting early, people joining late, whether or not it&#39;s legal to draw a massive Europe sized rectangle, where you&#39;re actually going to draw the rectangles, mold destroying the paper, the sun falling onto the Earth, forest burning, how much paper you have, how much paper you can get, someone pissing on the materiel you do end up using, and more.

mikiii880,"Hey CB, love you videos, however what I don&#39;t like is that sometimes your AI only learns one specific environment, and what it&#39;s essentially doing is overfitting until it succeedes the level. Good idea with the vectors coming from the car to map the walls, but I&#39;d also introduce a feature that represented the movement direction and speed (should be useful for drifts). Also instead of the reward gates that are specific only to your level, I&#39;d use as a reward the distance travelled in the good direction divided by the time it took to drive that far (or something among these lines, maybe squared distance) in order to encourage a faster speed. This way, the resulting model would generalise and be good on a different track.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcf-razKH8X9Ik-BYh8lBzg,60,2019-02-20T20:42:31Z,none,r428O_CMcpI

David Jameson,"I think a big reason the training took so long to proceed to getting a target was the binary training outcome of &quot;bad&quot; if crash (a good measure to keep), and &quot;good&quot; if getting a target. There&#39;s no in-between to ramp up progress and narrow the AI focus, so it effectively is casting a net across all potential paths until it eventually, by chance gets a target. Next, it&#39;ll take actions to get a target, and then randomly try to eventually get, by chance, another target, and so on, until some FAR off time of training later, it can fly between targets extremely well.<br><br>If you instead had an &quot;okay&quot; feedback mechanism, such as the duration of flight having a direct contribution to the &quot;score&quot; of feedback, you&#39;d be directly training the AI to stay airborne and not impact with each failure vs. each success of the learning iterations. Combine that with a huge point bonus to the score when collecting targets and you&#39;d be training your AI on two goals that complement each other simultaneously, providing both a long-term goal (the targets) and an immediate short-term goal for constant improvement (the time airborne).",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOKa4Zcj-2Q4lJhy0TcAQDw,60,2020-12-23T08:18:26Z,none,D5xX6nRWDko

RFMX,"Greetings, Code Bullet. I am a Guideline Tetris player. I saw that you want to take on people at Jstris. I totally support this idea. However, you may want to research a little more before you actually do this. You can search on the Hard Drop wiki, which is one of the most complete resources for everything Tetris. You should search for the following things: (sqaure brackets has the name of the Hard Drop wiki article)<br><br>- Jstris, like other modern Tetris games, use a randomiser called 7-bag. This means for every 7 pieces, each piece always appear once. Like IJLSZTO or ILZOSJT but not IIJSZOT or IJSSZZT. I don&#39;t think you implemented this in your Tetris game, but you will need to account for that in Jstris, reason illustrated later. [Random Generator]<br>- Jstris also has a kick system, meaning that the piece will move away from its original position after rotating. Super Rotation System (SRS) features a large range of kicks that can be confusing to others. However, they are very useful in fixing stacks and downstacking. [SRS]<br>- There is a very powerful attack solution, which is the 4-wide. This means the player leaves a column that is 4-block wide, and chain Singles inside the column. Theoretically, it can generate a 20-combo chain, but it can be really hard for a player to maintain, as they often need to plan pieces ahead. This is probably very easy for an AI. There is even a guide for maintaining a 4-wide combo at the Hard Drop wiki. [Combo Setups]<br>- Multiplayer features a system called garbage, which means you will get lines added at the bottom with only one hole. Different line clears (except singles, they do nothing) will send different amount of lines to the opponents. Most people stack for Tetris or T-spin Doubles, which both send 4 lines each. Almost all players are knocked out because they are sent a large amount of garbage, so the AI will need to learn how to attack in order to survive. (You need to check on the Jstris Guide for the specific details of lines sent)<br>- The best players can send over 100 lines per minute, while good players can often send around 60-80. The best players also place over 3 piece per second. You may want to compare that to your AI to see how it stacks up. (Personal experience, check leaderboards for details.)<br>- Beware of being banned. There is no specific rules that using a program is not acceptable, but this can be considered cheating by the moderators of the site. Be careful when you test the AI.<br><br>You should also ask other Tetris players, ideally better ones, about how they play and how they win games. I really hope that you can create an AI that can dominate the playing field, and take on even world-class players. Good luck on creating the best Tetris AI! Just a sidenote, there are also other websites that has multiplayer Tetris. You may want to check out <a href=""http://tetr.io/"">Tetr.io</a> as that is also very popular.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClRUxpj357awbNM_odlTjLQ,55,2020-07-23T10:21:45Z,none,QOJfyp0KMmM

Purple Ice,"TensorFlow is actually written in C++.<br><br>It&#39;s popular in Python only because Python is popular and all heavy work can be moved into C/C++ functions which are then called using Python&#39;s (actually, most languae implementations allow this, it&#39;s just that Python is so easy) FFI (Foreign Function Interface).<br><br>I believe, TensorFlow.js uses exact same thing, just assuming because they use exact same logo and if it was 3rd party project that has nothing to do with original Tensorflow, they&#39;d get hit pretty hard for that.<br><br>The experience can still vary, because what you can and cannot do in Python or JavaScript depends on how much work was put into allowing to use those foreign functions in respective language, which might explain why JavaScript one doesn&#39;t have support for placeholders yet.<br><br>TL;DR TensorFlow.js and Python package &quot;tensorflow&quot; are wrappers around actual TensorFlow.<br><br>Besides this minor thing, I enjoyed the video :)",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3a0UJxdkC7Swb18H_hfMQ,54,2019-02-20T19:37:45Z,none,r428O_CMcpI

Aimnos,"Could you make it so the A.I.  checks two consecutive frames to calculate the average velocity of the tiles based on same-colored pixel chunks and then have it draw the smallest path between it and the estimated position of the tile and aim a little lower than that for margin of error purposes? If so, could you please make another video on it to show how much it improves (or gets worse) compared to this code? If not, why? Is it too convoluted, do you not feel like it, the language and/or the program are far too limited to allow such an A.I. to exist, or is it flat-out just not possible to do so?<br>Also, is it possible to have the A.I. know the size of the tiles based on the pixel lines you highlighted, by indicating how much left/right from the checked pixels the pixel pattern repeats (since they are rectangular and such) and use that information to shorten the distance needed to travel from one tile to another?<br>Many thanks, love your vids.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8NXTWmVSeNmG1H0woGyQ3g,52,2019-01-25T22:37:06Z,none,wHRubMACen0

Liggliluff,"(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGUHehFGqBc&amp;t=5m20s"">5:20</a>) Technically, you don&#39;t have to divide it by the number of probabilities there are. You don&#39;t need a percentage. ‚Äì After checking all the probabilities, you then click on all squares with a total number of 0 boms on them. Then do the calculation again, and if there are no squares with 0, you click on one with 1, then do the check again. Repeat and always click on one of the lowest numbers, unless it&#39;s 0, then you can click them all. ‚Äì Dividing by the number of probabilities checked does gives you a percentage, but percentages requires float values, compared to integers who only requires integers. Floats are slower than integers (but processors are made to handle floats faster, because people overuse floats), and floats also have rounding issues, and doing the division is an unnecessary processing step.<br><br>Addendum: by also marking all the squares that got the same number of probabilities with bombs in them as probabilities checked; that is, a square that has value 83 and there were 83 boards checked, that means the square has a bomb guaranteed, and can be flagged. Still no need for division here. This means you have much less squares to test for the next time, increasing the processing power. So after an <i>n</i> amount of tests done, click on all squares with value 0 and flag all squares with value <i>n</i> and for all squares with values of 1 to <i>n</i> - 1 are ignored. If there are no squares with 0, click just one random one with a value of 1 and run the code again.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWWg36dwrb8njNsOFqpCAjA,50,2019-12-23T19:41:55Z,none,cGUHehFGqBc

2swap,"&quot;perfect&quot;<br>&quot;random first moves&quot;<br>????<br>Edit: I should probably clarify on why this is necessarily a bad idea, and why in general, your generalized &quot;probability&quot; algorithm isn&#39;t perfect either before i get piled on by commenters. Consider a situation in which you have 2 spaces denoted to be 50% chance of having a bomb. However, one may reveal information about the other, and thus eliminate some uncertainty when it must inevitably uncover the 2nd bomb. Your algorithm probably wouldn&#39;t favor either space over the other.<br>And in regards to the random first move shenanigans, I&#39;d imagine there is more information to be gained and therefore less risky decisions to get started in the corners since there are many fewer bordering squares, so it is much less likely to be a number (giving away more information), and also much more likely to give useful information if it is a number (since there are far fewer bordering squares.) To rectify this, I&#39;d just go ahead and test success ratios of each starting square.<br>Also, does your algorithm take into account the remaining amount of squares and tiles? I got the feeling from your explanation that it didn&#39;t.<br>tl;dr imperfect",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNLr9wX35KksK77mrQgxiw,45,2018-04-15T22:16:08Z,none,cGUHehFGqBc

They are used to track all sorts of things and are very fast ;)<br><br>On another note, your idea to extrapolate the position of the ball, based on its velocity was a good start, but can still be improved.<br> * For one, the angle the ball moves never changes, unless it collides with something. <br> * You do not need to search the whole screen for the ball. You have a rough estimate, where the ball should be, just look there. If it is not there, then you can search other places<br> * Just ignore the area, where the points are shown.

Dihydrogen Monoxide,"I would love to see you improve on this, i for one love to play chess casually, and therefor have never worried about capturing as many pieces as possible, instead it&#39;s just about taking the king at all costs. i would love to see you make a smart AI that can actually win a game of chess. part of where i think you went wrong was your objective. in those games we saw of AI vs AI you&#39;re AI was excelling at earning points by taking pieces, which is what you told it chess was all about. in reality, a game of chess has 1 main objective, kill the opponents king, a concept that seemed to be foreign to your AI. please do revisit this, and maybe try to make it so the AI is made to win the game, rather then capture pieces. i know this would mean providing the AI with some form of strategy or thinking WAY ahead, but i believe in you and your coding skills. it would also be interesting to see the AI have a resign feature, and when the AI hits a point at which they can no longer win (Assuming the player makes the correct moves) and then, after waiting a certain number of moves, perhaps 3-5, and if this situation doesn&#39;t get better, it resigns. resignation is a feature i find is missing from most chess apps, and if the goal is to have the most points, wouldn&#39;t resignation be helpful at some point to preserve your own pieces, once you have taken a large number of the opponent&#39;s pieces.<br><br>that&#39;s enough of my rambling, love the codes you make, keep up the great content bro.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnVPOx5Va9c7y64a8sKJfbg,41,2018-07-26T12:54:26Z,none,DZfv0YgLJ2Q

If you are not what version of Minesweeper are you using? <br>Also you cannot create a perfect Minesweeper Algorithm because the problem NP-complete.

Have you implemented spaces sharing groups of possible mines with other spaces, who then create a group to share. vice versa forever. <br>Also do you know that the first click does matter?

jinx12373,"Hey, I didnt look too closely at how you got python to &quot;see&quot; the ball, but some advice that made a huge difference for me: <br><br>Taking a sum total of a screenshot value will allow you to quickly recognize whether or not the ball in in an image, or if it is a base image. What I would have done in this situation is take screenshots in halves until I had reduced the ball into a square space that is the same size as the length of the paddle. It&#39;s not important to know exactly where the ball is, only that it is inside the paddle area. So by having a prebuilt library of what the screen looks like without the ball, and summing those colors number value in comparison to what it currently is, and working in big chunks into a smaller square would quickly allow the program to give &quot;good enough&quot; data, and perhaps even make the wins more common, as the best way to win is to actually have the paddle hit the ball closer to the edge. <br><br>If any of that makes sense.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_y6Xa1L3OoaXBQQdrST2Q,32,2019-01-04T23:00:37Z,none,tcymhYbRvw8

This video had quite succinctly captured the work published by CB the previous year, and that gave me quite the chuckle.<br><br>I watched it half a dozen more times, often getting most of the way through before I could even chance to hit the like button, or read through the other glowing reviews by my peers.<br><br>Hopefully even more videos will be released this year than last year.

Max Haibara,"Hi Code Bullet, I have a question about the activation function.<br><br>There are a lot of activation function, however my teacher said that the best one is Sigmoid (or tanh). But why? And is it really the best, just because it&#39;s continuous function? if it is, then can we design our own activation function and actually work well? I know that in CNN they use ReLU instead of Sigmoid. Then what happen if we use Sigmoid on CNN, or even our own activation function? <br><br>My teacher never answer question seriously, and they just said that it works better when you actually try it. But it still doesn&#39;t answer WHY it is the best. It might be better compared to the non-continuous step function, but is it better than all of the activation function? And also, why in my book there&#39;s only Sigmoid (or tanh) that is continuous as an activation function!<br><br>I think this topic will be an interesting tutorial video.

Zack Szekely,"I tried experimenting on it myself, and I&#39;ve been loving it so far! I know you said this project was massive and you want to be done with it, but I&#39;d love it if you could add one feature...<br><br>Please find a way to add an on/off toggleable option to make the creatures die if they try to break the physics engine.<br><br>I&#39;m guessing this could best be accomplished if you create a function that checks whether any body part is dragging across the ground. Obviously, body parts can still drag when the creatures aren&#39;t breaking the physics engine, so you&#39;d only want to kill them if the dragging body parts are the ONLY parts touching the ground for X amount of distance traveled.<br><br>I know that if the creatures aren&#39;t moving the way you intended, you can fix the problem by increasing the laser speed so long as your intended method of movement is faster than what the creatures are currently doing. But sometimes, glitchy physics just so happens to be faster than your intended method of movement, so the laser can&#39;t fix your problem. This has been quite limiting for me in some of the creature designs I&#39;ve experimented with.<br><br>Oh, and there&#39;s one other thing I&#39;d like. Hopefully this isn&#39;t asking too much, but when it comes to cosmetics, I think it&#39;d be hilarious if you let us use an image from our computer files rather than picking from the list. Or also, if the creatures could repeat any audio file from our computer, that would be just as great. Just think of the endless comedic possibilities!<br><br>So anyway, if you could add either of those two features -- the anti-physics breaker option and the import image or audio from computer option, I&#39;d love you for it! No homo though.<br><br>To anyone reading this comment: I&#39;m not sure if he reads all the comments on his videos.

Samuel Zhu,"bro i literally finished my tetris ai right before this video was uploaded:<br><br>a few things:<br>- im pretty sure the ai would benefit by putting the blocks on the outside versus the center, because growing the middle of the board basically splits the board in two, and less wide boards are less forgiving<br>- it should also penalize all height differences, even 1 block, since just about all blocks can be placed on a flat ground<br>- i also implemented a penalty if there is a chain of unevenness, since a bumpy board is a bit harder to stack on (though it does allow t-spins if you want to go for that)<br><br>these are all optimizations that i have learned from playing the game for a while, im sure that some of these may have some mathematics or theory backing how useful they are, feel free to add any corrections",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH3Q8KuTk49k80mJg3jUauA,23,2020-07-23T22:20:34Z,none,QOJfyp0KMmM

Chase Perrin,"If you want an algorithm that will survive a very long time, it will take a lot of memory, but look ahead with every possible combination until a certain goal is reached, like ever multiple tile, and discard the losing pathways from memory.  Then advance your move and repeat.  Use this logic to ensure that if it is possible to do so, you will always reach the next goal.  You still need to rank each path, but base it on the percentage chance of success.<br><br>You need to determine the likelihood that any given iteration can survive.  You can do that by assuming a move and all possible places a tile of a 2 or 4 could appear, which move produces a higher total likelihood of success.  At first, you would use a lot of memory due to the empty board, but after things fill up, it should run smoothly.  This isn&#39;t perfect because of the random behavior of the game, but should play with the best odds.<br><br>I&#39;m just too lazy to program this with no reason to do so, but still, it would be cool to see.  I think the problem with your algorithm was only looking 5 moves ahead.  Also, did you average the chance of success from each recursive path?  Assuming you used a recursive call to look ahead.<br><br>I would love to look at your code for this.  Seems fun.<br><br>EDIT:  I also realized, any path that leaves more open spaces should be ranked higher, as well as the corner method you mentioned.  It is important that it looks ahead for possible mistakes, and ranks things that would be detrimental to the game as a higher loss than just the normal likelihood.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt0u_LeCypZjznT1VaEz8-Q,23,2018-07-15T18:12:43Z,none,1g1HCYTX3Rg

Michiel De Muynck,"What? That makes no sense, those numbers (like the number of arrangements of bombs) are way too large for you to check all of them. For a 64x36 grid there are like 10^600 possible arrangements of bombs. So you have to be doing something to reduce that number. Do you do this &quot;probability calculation&quot; on small subsections of the grid? Do you randomly generate arrangements of bombs? The video stopped explaining at the point where it got interesting, as if you said you made a perfect chess engine by making the engine select the move with the best probability of winning, and no further explanation.<br><br>Either way, what you&#39;re trying to do though, creating a &quot;perfect&quot; minesweeper AI that can solve large grids perfectly in reasonable amount of time is well-known to be impossible.

J Kindrick,"It&#39;s my understanding that racing games generally have something like your reward gates, but are generally known as checkpoints.  In an attempt to keep players from gaming the system, certain checkpoints aren&#39;t valid until you hit the previous one, and the lap one isn&#39;t valid until you&#39;ve hit all the other ones.  Something that players figure out how to do, that AI might not figure out how to do, is game the system anyways by doing things that would &quot;punish&quot; the AI in the process, but get into a situation where they&#39;re hitting all the checkpoints in quick succession by not being on the track anymore.  The reason this is possible in certain games is because the checkpoints, for some reason, aren&#39;t just on the track, but off it too, in areas that the player isn&#39;t supposed to be able to go.  For example, in one of the Mario Kart games, there&#39;s a pillar up on a wall that you can launch yourself up onto.  An AI would never think to do this, because why would it waste time doing this when the next reward gate is right up ahead?  Anyways, once up there, players can start hitting all the checkpoints, including the lap one, just by going around this little pillar in the opposite direction that you&#39;re supposed to go around the track, because, for some unfathomable reason, all the checkpoints extend to being around this pillar, mirroring the track.<br><br><br>tl;dr:  Can AI find exploits in games?",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWtZ9zcpXZD7x6sYyNm90vA,18,2019-02-20T12:29:11Z,none,r428O_CMcpI

Checkmate6659's Speedruns,"i think for the A* solution, we should have a &quot;lifetime&quot; for each part of the snake: the tail would be 0, the part before it would be 1, etc... If the node&#39;s g-cost is strictly superior to the snake&#39;s track, then it will be a wall, otherwise it will be a walkable node. This could allow you to solve this weird problem. Also, you should write it in Java, as it&#39;s easier to make graphical interfaces than C++, and it&#39;s compiled, so it&#39;s much faster than Javascript. To make it even faster, you can reduce the number of &quot;legal moves&quot; to 3: do nothing, turn left, and turn right. You can also take a similar approach as chess: moving your king in check is illegal, and when you run out of moves, the game ends. Similarly, you could forbid the snake to crash into a wall, and consider it dead when the head is surrounded by the body, aka when the snake can&#39;t escape death on the next frame.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjQIO1rqTBE&amp;t=10m20s"">10:20</a> There is a bug in the implementation: there is only 1 empty tile, yet the snake still goes in survival mode, because I think it is 80% of the tiles, and not 80% of the empty tiles that it has to reach...",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNKqNf6xKszwcSO_FTaRkGw,16,2021-04-16T13:17:14Z,none,tjQIO1rqTBE

Roger Smith,"@Code Bullet<br>Clicking on a safest square is a good strategy, but it is far from perfect. You need to make a click which maximizes your chances of winning, not just minimizes chances of instant death. This is harder but gives a better result (and more fun).<br><br>Example: you have a positions with only one bomb and three remaining squares. One square is completely surrounded by bombs and two others surrounded by bombs together. Which square you need to click? Your algorithm says it does not matter - the chances of bomb being on any square is the same (1/3). But it DOES matter. If you click on a single square your chances of winning is 2/3*1/2=1/3 (you can die instantly or, if you survive, you will have to guess second time with 1 bomb on two remaining squares). But if you click on one of adjoined squares your chances of winning is 2/3 (you will either die instantly, or win, since your move will reveal the remaining bomb location).<br><br>Hate to bring you down to earth, pal, but you still not reached a perfection :)<br><br>PS. Creating a good mineweeper strategy with the goal of maximizing the chances of winning is interesting enough task, worth the usage of Machine Learning (brute-force probabilistic approach may be impossible due to combinatorial explosion in the strategical plannig process). But i think creating strategy which emulates what expert human players do is even more interesting. Humans play to get the best possible time, and they can abandon game if beginning is not looking promising. I&#39;d say we limit a total number of clicks which our algoritm can do in evaluation session (but still enough to play about hundred average games) and the target metric should be something like minimal number of clicks in succesful game (our algorithm can abandon the game at any time if it will decide that continuing it is counter-productive). Now THAT is an interesting challenge!",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRQdiwUZOAj1MWVOGpSv3g,12,2019-04-21T17:54:26Z,none,cGUHehFGqBc

Flat Finger Tuning,"I don&#39;t think your strategy is sufficient, since correctly guessing that a square does not have a bomb doesn&#39;t mean one wins the game.   If one square has a 2/5 chance of containing a bomb, but correctly guessing it would guarantee victory, while another square has a 1/5 chance of containing a bomb, but correctly guessing it would still leave one with a 50-50 guess, optimal strategy should favor picking the first since it would yield a 60% chance of victory, vs. 40% for picking the second.",http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvOjdLvczlZJWIVksAd8kAA,12,2018-04-15T04:03:23Z,none,cGUHehFGqBc
